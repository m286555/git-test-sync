POC success from Marvel server

I am successful with my first git test
Now I can work with the git hub easily 

the commands I used:
git add file_name
git commit -m "my message"
git push origin main

next command I need to use is
git pull origin main


Now I am adding more line to test my git account 
Lets see how I progress with git
